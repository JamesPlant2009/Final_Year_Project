# Web based training System

This web based training system is James Plants' Final Year Project submission. The purpose of this system is to allow Ames Goldsmith the digitalize their training system.

To ensure the system works as intended please use XAMPP and store the project files in the htdocs file of the XAMPP install within a slef created folder called php_programs. This will allow the Database connect to the front end system.

Also please ensure that when using XAMPP to import the sql file containing my systems database into the system using the name "ames" for the database.

Please also ensure that a privilege is created for the user in the database with teh username "James" and the password "Plant" with the host name as "%" as detailed in the setting.php file. Also ensure that this new user has access to the data privileges.

Any questions about the use of this system please email: JamesPlant2009@gmail.com.

Thank you!
